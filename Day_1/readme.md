## What is SQL?
- Structured query language (SQL) is a programming language for storing and processing information in a relational database.
- A relational database stores information in tabular form, with rows and columns representing different data attributes and the various relationships between the data values. - You can use SQL statements to store, update, remove, search, and retrieve information from the database. You can also use SQL to maintain and optimize database performance.

## What is NoSQL?
- NoSQL refers to non-relational databases that don't use tables to store data. 
- Developers store information in different types of NoSQL databases, including graphs, documents, and key-values. NoSQL databases are popular for modern applications because they are horizontally scalable. 
- Horizontal scaling means increasing the processing power by adding more computers that run NoSQL software.

## SQL vs. NoSQL
- Structured query language (SQL) provides a uniform data manipulation language, but NoSQL implementation is dependent on different technologies.
- Developers use SQL for transactional and analytical applications, whereas NoSQL is suitable for responsive, heavy-usage applications. 

## CREATE DATABASE
- The CREATE DATABASE statement is used to create a new SQL database.
- Syntax: CREATE DATABASE databasename;

## CREATE TABLE
- In the SQL database for creating a table, we use a command called CREATE TABLE.
- Syntax: CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
   ....
);
  
## SELECT queries
- The SELECT Statement in SQL is used to retrieve or fetch data from a database.
- We can fetch either the entire table or according to some specified rules. The data returned is stored in a result table.
- Syntax: SELECT column1,column2
          FROM table_name
