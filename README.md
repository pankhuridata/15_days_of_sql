# 15_days_of_sql
There’s a challenge called the #30DaysOfSQL challenge, where engineers code with SQL for 30 days straight by engaging in projects, online tests and other practical means available. I wanted to put a spin on this and condense this into 15 days instead. This force me to consistently learn SQL for 15 days straight in an engaging and easy-to-manage approach without overwhelming myself with too much too soon.


# Day 1
## What is SQL?
- Structured query language (SQL) is a programming language for storing and processing information in a relational database.
- A relational database stores information in tabular form, with rows and columns representing different data attributes and the various relationships between the data values. - You can use SQL statements to store, update, remove, search, and retrieve information from the database. You can also use SQL to maintain and optimize database performance.

## What is NoSQL?
- NoSQL refers to non-relational databases that don't use tables to store data. 
- Developers store information in different types of NoSQL databases, including graphs, documents, and key-values. NoSQL databases are popular for modern applications because they are horizontally scalable. 
- Horizontal scaling means increasing the processing power by adding more computers that run NoSQL software.

## SQL vs. NoSQL
- Structured query language (SQL) provides a uniform data manipulation language, but NoSQL implementation is dependent on different technologies.
- Developers use SQL for transactional and analytical applications, whereas NoSQL is suitable for responsive, heavy-usage applications. 

## CREATE DATABASE
- The CREATE DATABASE statement is used to create a new SQL database.
- Syntax: CREATE DATABASE databasename;

## CREATE TABLE
- In the SQL database for creating a table, we use a command called CREATE TABLE.
- Syntax: CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
   ....
);
