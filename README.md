# 15_days_of_sql
Thereâ€™s a challenge called the #30DaysOfSQL challenge, where engineers code with SQL for 30 days straight by engaging in projects, online tests and other practical means available. I wanted to put a spin on this and condense this into 15 days instead. This force me to consistently learn SQL for 15 days straight in an engaging and easy-to-manage approach without overwhelming myself with too much too soon.
